Python Dictionaries

Python provides another composite data type called a dictionary, which is similar to a list in that it is a collection of objects.

Dictionaries and lists share the following characteristics:

Both are mutable.
Both are dynamic. They can grow and shrink as needed.
Both can be nested. A list can contain another list. A dictionary can contain another dictionary. A dictionary can also contain a list, and vice versa.
Dictionaries differ from lists primarily in how elements are accessed:

List elements are accessed by their position in the list, via indexing.
Dictionary elements are accessed via keys.

Defining a Dictionary
Dictionaries are Python’s implementation of a data structure that is more generally known as an associative array. A dictionary consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value.

You can define a dictionary by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). A colon (:) separates each key from its associated value:
